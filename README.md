Demonstration of field validation
=================================

This is a simple project that demonstrates possibility to verify and validate UITextField content on the input in the Text Fields itself, t.i. not in the View Controllers, that are kept clean.

Solution is very modular and can be used for UITextField and theur subclasses anywhere.
